Dit is de redactie pagina, ook voor als je meedoet in de show.
Dit is een "hidden link" op de tv.osgeo.nl site.
Niet dat hier geheimen instaan (maar deel geen wachtwoorden in bijv de Google Docs!), maar
voor de gemiddelde kijker niet relevant. Mogelijk maken we deze pagina wel tzt publiek.
Ivm met buitenlandse gasten zijn delen in Engels.

## Eerste Keer - First Timer - Gast - Guest
We use [StreamYard.com](https://streamyard.com) as a "Broadcast Studio in The Cloud". 
The StreamYard concept is different from Zoom, Jitsi etc: it is not a tele-conferencing tool, 
but really a (virtual) broadcast studio, "Dutch: virtuele TV-studio".

The good news is: you don't need to install anything! 
Just use a current browser (Chrome/Brave works best for some Firefox).
NOT: Safari, IE/Edge or smartphones, tablets!

Like with Jitsi or other browser-based tools you need to confirm
that the StreamYard webapp has access to your computer's audio (mic + output)
and video. Within StreamYard you can still choose which A/V devices to use and test them.

Basically we all connect to the same StreamYard web-page, the "broadcast studio"  
at StreamYard.com via a unique weblink (see "Links" below). 
Each episode will
have a unique StreamYard link for the show's participants only.
This link will be published in our Telegram group
and sent to all guests in the show. It is not to be shared, though the nice 
aspect of StreamYard is that one always enters "Backstage", so unlike many of
the teleconferencing tools there is no chance of an "intruder" within the lice show.

Each show-participant basically streams (from our browsers) 
to the "broadcast studio". StreamYard makes the composite video and will stream
live to [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/osgeonl) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvSAN6ur4RoGUqxtvmgsb8g) but
only during broadcast timeframe. Not e.g. while preparing. 
Viewers watch the show via YouTube and Twitch. The show is also recorded for later viewing on YouTube.

There are some things you need to know, tips & tricks, especially when first 
time in the show, read more here:

## Preparation - Repetitie

We usually do a run-through (doorloop) before the broadcast, usually the day before. 
There we specifically test with first-time guests their Audio/Video and screen-sharing.
The preparation studio has a fixed link and is setup for local use only, i.e. it is never broadcasted.

The link to the preparation studio ("repetitie ruimte") is:

*THIS LINK IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL BROADCAST LINK YOU WILL RECEIVE JUST BEFORE THE BROADCAST.*
